1.2.1
New Features:
	Using UIDSystem, you can choose to avoid child gameobject serialization.
	Using UIDSystem, you can control the components that you prefer to serialize.
	Providing RSUtility class, to help developers create plugin compatible gameobjects/prefab clones at runtime.
	
Changes:
	UIDSystem code is refined and exposes methods to Update/Reassign UID's at runtime.
	UIDSystem Editor inspector provides buttons to Update and Reset UID's.
	RendererRSExtension serializes sorting order and layer as well.

	UIDSystem overcomes limitations of RS such as unique name for GameObjects, Gameobject cant have multiple component of same type.
	IRuntimeSerializableActivator interface provides control of object creation while deserializing.
	RSExtensionManager allows mapping types to its extensions, which can avoid use of Reflection.
	You can add intializer properties to RuntimeSerializationInfo. Useful for creating objects with custom definition by providing serialized intializer values.
	Supports Unity2D types: Collider2D, Sprite, SpriteRenderer, Rigidbody2D, PhysicsMaterial2D.
	Supports Unity3D types: Joints, Lights, Camera, NavMesh.
	Supports Generic Collection types: Queue, Stack, HashSet.
	Supports System types: Guid, TimeSpan.
	Supports Prefab serialization.
	Supports Edit mode serialization.
	
Changes:
	Material serialization is fully functional.
	By default RuntimeSerializable attribute serializes all public variables.
	RuntimeSerializable attribute allows us to define extension dependency for any object. Useful for serializing properties of parent class which belongs to external library.
	ObjectWriter and ObjectReader is completely generic and is capable of handling serialization of any type.
